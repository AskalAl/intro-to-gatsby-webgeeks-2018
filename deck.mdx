# Intro to Gatsby
It's the future, y'all
---
# My notes
- Why `import React`? It's dumb and weird.
- As an experienced JS Dev, I struggled with knowing WTF was going on in some places.
- Example: arrow functions with no curly braces, returning JSX.
- When do I need to wrap with parens and when not?
- Pretty adds semicolons in front of JSX tags sometimes which freaked me out
---
# What is Gatsby?
- Static site builder
- Built using React components
- Leverages GraphQL for fetching data within components
---
# Installing Gatsby

<div style={{ fontSize: '1.5em' }}>

```
yarn global add gatsby-cli
gatsby new my-gatsby-project
```

</div>

export default FullScreenCode

```jsx
  // src/pages/index.js

  import React from 'react'
  import Link from 'gatsby-link'
  const IndexPage = () => (
    <div>
      <h1>Hi people</h1>
      <p>Welcome to your new Gatsby site.</p>
      <p>Now go build something great.</p>
      <Link to="/page-2/">Go to page 2</Link>
    </div>
  )
  export default IndexPage
```

export default FullScreenCode

```jsx
  // src/pages/page-2.js

  import React from 'react'
  import Link from 'gatsby-link'

  const SecondPage = () => (
    <div>
      <h1>Hi from the second page</h1>
      <p>Welcome to page 2</p>
      <Link to="/">Go back to the homepage</Link>
    </div>
  )

  export default SecondPage

```
